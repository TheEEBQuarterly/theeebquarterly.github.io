Below are photo credits and descriptions for pages 28-29, the field work world map.

## From top left to top right:

## Julia Charlebois:

This picture was taken in Bouchette, Quebec, in an old field ecosystem where I was conducting
research examining the influence of spatial relationships on pollinator-mediated interactions
between plants. Shown is the introduced Syrphid fly, Eristalis tenax, a honeybee imitator,
visiting an inflorescence of Achillea millefolium.

## Felipe Torres:

Grad students from the Heliconia project. The research team is based at the Organization for
Tropical Studies Las Cruces Biological Station in Costa Rica (https://tropicalstudies.org/); all
field work is conducted in the fragmented landscape that surrounds the station.

## Kiran Wadhawan:

A perfect end to a perfect day at Salmon Coast Field Station. Located in the Broughton
Archipelago B.C., Salmon Coast Field Station is a non-profit conservation organization
providing students with a place to conduct their research on marine life.

## Laura McCaw:

Sheep Mountain (Thachäl Dhäl) reflected in Kluane Lake on a calm day.

## Cyltia Guy:

Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in gloved hand. Caught as part of a landscape study in High
Park, Toronto.

## Sean Anderson:

Female (top) and male (bottom) of the peacock bass species, Cichla ocellaris, from the Rewa
river in Guyana, 2018. Several species of peacock bass occur throughout the neotropics, though
the exact number is debated in the literature (and with it, basically, the practice of taxonomy:
Kullander and Ferreira 2006 v. Willis 2017). The distinctive hump on the male indicates that this
individual is in breeding condition; the fatty hump will be reabsorbed after spawning. Each year
the first breeding typically occurs just prior to the rainy season. A few days after these two were
caught, the rains began.

quantitative genetics study of plant fitness responses to global change in the Experimental
Climate Warming Array at Koffler Scientific Reserve at Jokers Hill.
