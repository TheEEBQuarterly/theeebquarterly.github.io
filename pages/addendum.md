# Volume 5, Issue 1

Several changes were made to the Editor's Letter (page 5) after the initial release. All changes are documented below.

## Initial Letter (paragraphs 2 and 4)

*As I write this, it has been 100 days since Israel began its war on Gaza. 100 days of inhuman destruction. 100 days of Palestinian displacement. 100 days of civilian strikes. The brutal loss of life is staggering.
...
I would be remiss to not mention that it has also been 100 days of increased anti-semitism. Racial
and ethnic hatred is what leads to these atrocities on a massive scale.*

## Version 2 (changes on paragraphs 2 and 4)

*As I write this, it has been 100 days since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. 100 days of inhuman
destruction. 100 days of Palestinian displacement. 100 days of civilian strikes. The brutal loss of life
is staggering.
...
I would be remiss to not mention that it has also been 100 days of increased anti-semitism, 100 days since over a thousand Israelis and foreign nationalities were murdered, and 100 days since hostages have been kidnapped from their homes. Racial and ethnic hatred is what leads to these atrocities on a massive scale.*

## Julia Charlebois:

This picture was taken in Bouchette, Quebec, in an old field ecosystem where I was conducting
research examining the influence of spatial relationships on pollinator-mediated interactions
between plants. Shown is the introduced Syrphid fly, Eristalis tenax, a honeybee imitator,
visiting an inflorescence of Achillea millefolium.

## Felipe Torres:

Grad students from the Heliconia project. The research team is based at the Organization for
Tropical Studies Las Cruces Biological Station in Costa Rica (https://tropicalstudies.org/); all
field work is conducted in the fragmented landscape that surrounds the station.

## Kiran Wadhawan:

A perfect end to a perfect day at Salmon Coast Field Station. Located in the Broughton
Archipelago B.C., Salmon Coast Field Station is a non-profit conservation organization
providing students with a place to conduct their research on marine life.

## Laura McCaw:

## Cyltia Guy:

Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in gloved hand. Caught as part of a landscape study in High
Park, Toronto.

## Sean Anderson:

Female (top) and male (bottom) of the peacock bass species, Cichla ocellaris, from the Rewa
river in Guyana, 2018. Several species of peacock bass occur throughout the neotropics, though
the exact number is debated in the literature (and with it, basically, the practice of taxonomy:
Kullander and Ferreira 2006 v. Willis 2017). The distinctive hump on the male indicates that this
individual is in breeding condition; the fatty hump will be reabsorbed after spawning. Each year
the first breeding typically occurs just prior to the rainy season. A few days after these two were
caught, the rains began.

Sunny Lake, within the Wildlife Research Area of Algonquin Provincial Park, is a stunning
summer sight to behold. With turtles, leeches and fishes below the surface; watershield, lilies,
waterfowl and frogs floating at the surface; and salamanders and songbirds in the surrounding
forest, Sunny Lake is an ecologist's paradise. It is no surprise then that Sunny Lake is a 'legacy
site', home to turtles from the 46-year mark-recapture study based at the Algonquin Wildlife
Research Station, with EEB Professor Njal Rollinson as a project collaborator.

## Lauren Jarvis:

Photo from Chibow Lake near Blind River, ON. I was gillnetting in northern Ontario with the
ministry of natural resources' broadscale monitoring (BsM) program, collecting fish (walleye,
northern pike, cisco, yellow perch) muscle tissue for stable isotope analysis.

## Daniel Gillis:

The photo of the red pine was taken at the lookout from Booth's Rock in Algonquin Park,
overlooking Rock Lake on a hike with my sister and her boyfriend. Both of these photos were
taken in August 2017.

## Courtney Leermakers:

I am entering my first year of my M.Sc. EEB, and over this summer I started collecting data with
the Toronto Zoo. I got to check baited hoop traps, radio track, and road survey for turtles as part
of my project in Nick Mandrak and Marc Cadotte's lab. We are working alongside the Zoo on a
road ecology project to assess the mitigation success for an Eco passage to be installed. In this
photo you can see an adorable little painted turtle that was an opportunistic find when I noticed it
basking on a log. We measured carapace length and width, plastron length and width, height, and
we weighed this individual. Normally we would also notch and PIT tag the turtle, however this
one was too small.
