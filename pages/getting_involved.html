## __How to get involved as a writer__

We solicit essay commitments at the end of each publication month (September, December, March, and June). At this point, interested grad students are invited to sign up to write an essay for the following issue under one of the four continuously-running essay categories (see below).
Alternatively, students can (and are encouraged to!) pitch their own ideas for an essay or written piece. Feature slots are filled on a first-come, first-served basis. Submissions come in various sizes – 500 word blurbs and 5000 word essays are both welcome. So start thinking about what you’d like to write!


## __How to get involved as an artist or photographer__

Our department is rich with talented artists, illustrators, and photographers - something we’re keen to celebrate. Each quarter, we solicit art and photography to be featured on the cover and throughout the magazine.


### __For photographers:__

As graduate students in ecology and evolution, many of us have the unique opportunity to conduct work in remote and/or interesting places. If you’ve been in the field and have images to share of natural settings or wildlife, please submit some for the rest of us to see. 
Photos don’t have to come from the field alone. If you’ve been in your garden (or someone else’s), or have hiked, or have noticed something interesting while walking around campus and happen to have taken a photo, please submit.
Finally, there is a bit more to science than standing in beautiful places. If you have high quality photos depicting other aspects of your work, such as photos from the lab, library, conferences, your CT scanner, etc., please submit! 


### __For Artists:__

Our department is fortunate to have an unusual number of gifted artists. We will accept submissions of images on virtually any subject matter - it does not have to relate to nature or science. We simply want to showcase the talent and vision of department members. Please submit in RAW or jpeg format with highest resolution possible to seanas.anderson@mail.utoronto.ca


## __How to get involved as an editor__

Interested students can sign on to volunteer as editors during the Spring EGSA meeting.
